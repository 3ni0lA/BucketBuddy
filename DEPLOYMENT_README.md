## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **AWS Account** with CLI configured
2. **GitHub Repository** with your BucketBuddy code
3. **Terraform** installed locally
4. **Local PostgreSQL backup** (we'll migrate this)

> **Note:** No GitHub tokens required! We use modern CodeStar connections for secure GitHub integration.

## 🏗️ Step 1: Prepare Your Local Database Backup

First, let's backup your existing database:

```bash
# Your backup is already created at:
ls -la /tmp/bucketbuddy_backup.sql
```

If you need to create a fresh backup:
```bash
pg_dump postgres://buddyuser:securepassword@localhost:5432/bucketbuddy > /tmp/bucketbuddy_backup.sql
```

## 🔧 Step 2: Configure Terraform Variables

1. **Copy the example variables file:**
```bash
cd terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

2. **Edit terraform.tfvars with your information:**
```hcl
# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-west-2"
alert_email = "devprecious@gmail.com"

# Application Configuration  
app_name = "bucketbuddy"
environment = "production"
container_port = 5000

# Database Configuration
db_name = "bucketbuddy"
db_username = "buddyuser"
db_password = "securepassword"  # Use your actual password

# GitHub Repository Configuration
github_owner = "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
github_repo = "BucketBuddy"  # Your repo name
github_branch = "main"
# No github_token needed! CodeStar connections handle authentication
```

## 🔗 Step 3: Modern GitHub Integration with CodeStar Connections

### 🎯 What is CodeStar Connections?

CodeStar Connections is AWS's **modern, secure way to connect AWS services to GitHub** without using personal access tokens. This deployment uses the latest AWS recommended approach for GitHub integration.

### 💰 **Cost: FREE** ✅
- No additional charges for CodeStar connections
- Stays within your $0/month deployment goal
- No API call fees or data transfer charges

### 🔐 **Security Benefits vs Traditional Tokens:**

| **Aspect** | **Old Method (Tokens)** | **CodeStar Connections** |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Security** | Personal tokens in code | Encrypted GitHub App integration |
| **Permissions** | Broad account access | Repository-specific permissions |
| **Expiration** | Manual rotation needed | Automatic renewal |
| **Audit Trail** | Limited visibility | Full AWS CloudTrail integration |
| **Setup** | Token management | One-time browser authorization |
| **AWS Status** | Deprecated ⚠️ | Recommended ✅ |

### 🚀 **How It Works:**

```
GitHub Push → CodeStar Connection → CodePipeline → CodeBuild → CodeDeploy → PM2 Reload
```

1. **Secure Bridge**: Creates encrypted connection between AWS and GitHub
2. **GitHub Apps**: Uses modern GitHub Apps instead of personal tokens
3. **Fine-grained Permissions**: Only accesses your specific repository
4. **Automatic Management**: Handles authentication renewals automatically

### 🛠️ **Setup Process (One-Time):**

**Phase 1: Terraform Creates Connection (Automated)**
```bash
# This happens automatically during terraform apply
# Creates connection in "PENDING" status
```

**Phase 2: Manual Authorization (One-Time, 2 minutes)**
After terraform apply, you'll see this in the outputs:
```
🚀 DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE! Next steps:

1. ACTIVATE GITHUB CONNECTION:
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections
